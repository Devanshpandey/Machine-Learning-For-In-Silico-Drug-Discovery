# Machine-Learning-For-In-Silico-Drug-Discovery
Repository for code maintenance of BTP 

For the first part of #BTP I have focuded on building ML methods for Target Discovery.
For Target Discovery I have fouces on builiding ML methods for predicting #pIC50 value which corresponds to the negative log of the IC50 value when converted to molar.

First method is based on #Ligand-Based-Drug-Discovery in which I have used BACE enzyme dataset to prdict the pIC50 value using regression algorithms.

Second method is based on #Structure-Based-Drug-Discovery in which I have used PDB structres of Protein and Ligand and created grid fingerprints of Protein-Ligand complexes and used that structural information to predict the value of pIC50
